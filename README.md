# SnakeGame
"Snake" implemented by only StdDraw, StdIn, Lists and Nodes. Written in Java, right after my first programming course.
The game is played using the "wasd" keys.
The user has control over these components of the game:
-Play Manually or Automatically
-The number of snake food pieces on the board
-The speed the snake travels at
-If you can collide through the walls or not
